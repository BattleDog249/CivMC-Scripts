## Usage

This repository is not officially affiliated with the CivMC server.

Currently supports JsMacros 1.8.3 for Minecraft 1.18.2

All scripts within are designed to conform to the botting rules of CivMC

### Botting Rules
    • Bots and mods must follow all vanilla behavior including but not limited to: Physics, Occlusion, Movement, etc.
    • Bots and mods are allowed to read any inventory, their selected hot bar slot, their own location, their health, their hunger, their potion effects, their EXP, their boss bar, chat messages, kick reasons, player logins/logouts, the tab list and nothing else.
    • Reading environmental data in particular is not allowed. This includes the location of any entities and any blocks. The only exception for this is for minimap and radar mods used within your Minecraft client to display entities on a 2 dimensional map or radar.
    • Bots and mods can only read server provided chat messages, not ones generated by client side mods.
    • Bots and scripts may not be used to directly help a player during combat.
