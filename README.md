Currently supports the latest version of JsMacros for Minecraft 1.18.2

All scripts within are designed to conform to the botting rules of CivMC:
    
    • Bots are allowed to read any inventory, their selected hot bar slot, their own location, their health, their hunger, their potion effects, their EXP, their boss bar, chat messages, kick reasons, player logins/logouts, the tab list and nothing else.
    
    • Reading environmental data in particular is not allowed. This includes the location of any entities and any blocks.
    
    • Bots can only read server provided chat messages, not ones generated by client side mods.
    
    • Bots and scripts may not be used to directly help a player fight during combat.
